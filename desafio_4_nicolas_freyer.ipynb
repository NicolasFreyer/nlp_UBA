And all the people that come and go Stop and say \"Hello\". On the corner is a banker with a motorcar, And little children laugh at him behind his back. And the banker never wears a mac In the pouring rain, very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass, And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen. He likes to keep his fire engine clean, It\\'s a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. A four of fish and finger pies In summer. Meanwhile back Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray. And though she feels as if she\\'s in a play, She is anyway. In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer, We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim, And then the fireman rushes in From the pouring rain - very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies I sit, and meanwhile back. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes. There beneath the blue suburban skies Penny Lane!

Let the sky fall, when it crumbles We will stand tall And face it all together Let the sky fall, when it crumbles We will stand tall And face it all together At sky fall Let the sky fall We will stand tall At skyfall (Verse 1) There\\'s a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and it\\'s bringing me out the dark Finally I can see you crystal clear Go head and sell me out and I\\'ll lay your ship bare See how I\\'ll leave with every piece of you Don\\'t underestimate the things that I will do There\\'s a fire starting in my heart Reaching a fever pitch and it\\'s bringing me out the dark Chorus 1 The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinkin\\' that we almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me breathless I can\\'t help feeling, we could\\'ve had it all... (You\\'re gonna wish you never met me) Rolling in the deep... (Tears are gonna fall rollin\\' in the deep) You had my heart inside of your hand (You\\'re gonna wish you never met me) And you played it to the beat (Tears are gonna fall rollin\\' in the deep) Verse 2 Baby I have no story to be told But I\\'ve heard one on you and I\\'m gonna make your head burn Think of me in the depths of your despair Making a home down there, as mine sure won\\'t be shared (Chorus 2) The scars of your love remind me of us They keep me thinkin\\' that we almost had it all The scars of your love, they leave me breathless I can\\'t help feeling, we could\\'ve had it all Rolling in the deep... you had my heart inside of your hand And you played it to the beat Could\\'ve had it all... Rollin\\' in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand But you played it with a beating (Verse 3) Throw your stone through every open door Count your blessings to find what you look for Turn my sorrow into treasured gold You pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow (Chorus 3) We could\\'ve had it all... We could\\'ve had it all... It all, It all, It all... We could\\'ve had it all... Rollin\\' in the deep... You had my heart inside of your hand And you played it to the beat Could\\'ve had it all Rollin\\' in the deep You had my heart inside of your hand But you played it, you played it, you played it, you played it to the beat Some say, I\\'ll be better without you, They don\\'t know you like I do, Or at least as far as I thought I knew I can\\'t bear this time, It drags, as I lose my mind Reminded by things I find I know some clothes you left behind. Wake me up, wake me up when all is done I won\\'t rise until this battle\\'s won My dignity is become undone But I won\\'t go I can\\'t do it on my own If this ain\\'t love, then what is? I\\'m willing to take the risk I won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own, If this is ain\\'t love, then what is? I\\'m willing to take the risk So petrified, I\\'m so scared to step into this right, What if I lose my heart and fail the ? I won\\'t forgive me if I gave up trying I heard his voice today I didn\\'t know a single word he said Now I\\'m resemblance to the man I met Just a vague and broken boy instead But I won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own If this ain\\'t love, then what is? I\\'m willing to take the risk I won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own If this ain\\'t love, then what is? I\\'m willing to take the risk There will be times, we\\'ll try and give it up Bursting at the seams, no doubt We almost fall apart and burn up easy So watch them turn to dust But nothing will never taint us I won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own If this ain\\'t love, then what is? I\\'m willing to take the risk I won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on my own If this ain\\'t love, then what is? I\\'m willing to take the risk Will he, will he still remember me? Will he still love me even when he\\'s free Or will he go back to the place where He will choose the poison over me? When we spoke yesterday He said to hold my breath, to sit and wait I\\'ll be home soon, I won\\'t be late He won\\'t go He can\\'t do it on his own If this ain\\'t love, then what is? He\\'s willing to take the risk So I won\\'t go, I can\\'t do it on his own, If this ain\\'t love, then what is? I\\'m willing to take the risk \\'Cause he won\\'t go He can\\'t do it on his own If this ain\\'t love, then what is? We\\'re willing to take the risk I won\\'t go! I can\\'t do it on my own If this ain\\'t love, then what is? I\\'m willing to take the risk I let it fall, my heart, And as it fell you rose to claim it It was dark and I was over Until you kissed my lips and you saved me My hands, they\\'re strong But my knees were far too weak To stand in your arms Without falling to your feet But there\\'s a side to you That I never knew, never knew All the things you\\'d say They were never true, never true And the games you play You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried \\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name, Your name When I lay with you I could stay there Close my eyes Feel you here forever You and me together nothing gets better \\'Cause there\\'s a side to you That I never knew, never knew All the things you\\'d say They were never true, never true And the games you play You would always win, always win But I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried \\'Cause I heard it screaming out your name, Your name I set fire to the rain And I threw us into the flames Well, it felt something died \\'Cause I knew that that was The last time, the last time Sometimes I wake up by the door, That heart you caught must be waiting for you Even now when we\\'re already over I can\\'t help myself from looking for you I set fire to the rain Watched it pour as I touched your face Well, it burned while I cried \\'Cause I heard it screaming Out your name, Your name I set fire to the rain, And I threw us into the flames Well, it felt something died \\'Cause I knew that, that was the last time The last time Let it burn Let it burn Let it burn Daydreamer Sitting on the sea Soaking up the sun He is a real lover And making up the past Feeling up his girl Like he\\'s never felt a figure before A jaw dropper Looks good when he walks Is the subject of their talk He would be hard to chase But good to catch And he could change the world With his hands behind his back, oh You can find him sittin\\' on your doorstep Waiting for a surprise And he will feel like he\\'s been there for hours And you can tell that he\\'ll be there for life Daydreamer With eyes that make you melt He lends his coat for shelter Plus he\\'s there for you When he shouldn\\'t be But he stays all the same Waits for you Then sees you through There\\'s no way I Could describe him What I\\'ll say is Just what I\\'m hoping for But I will find him sittin\\' on my doorstep Waiting for a surprise And he will feel like he\\'s been there for hours And I can tell that he\\'ll be there for life And I can tell that he\\'ll be there for life With your loving, there ain\\'t nothing That I can\\'t adore The way I\\'m running, with you, honey Is we can break every low I find it funny that you\\'re the only One I never looked for There is something in your loving That tears down my walls I wasn\\'t ready then, I\\'m ready now I\\'m heading straight for you You will only be eternally The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion Hitting me like an explosion All of my life, I\\'ve been frozen The sweetest devotion I\\'ve known I\\'ll forever be whatever you want me to be I\\'ll go under and all over for your clarity When you wonder if I\\'m gonna lose my way home Just remember, that come whatever, I\\'ll be yours all alone I wasn\\'t ready then, I\\'m ready now I\\'m heading straight for you You will only be eternally The one that I belong to The sweetest devotion Hitting me like an explosion All of my life, I\\'ve been frozen The sweetest devotion I\\'ve known I\\'ve been looking for you, baby In every face that I\\'ve ever known And there is something \\'bout the way you love me That finally feels like home All my life, you\\'re my darkness You\\'re the right kind of madness And you\\'re my hope, you\\'re my despair You\\'re my scope, everything, everywhere The sweetest devotion Hitting me like an explosion All of my life, I\\'ve been frozen The sweetest devotion I\\'ve known Sweetest It\\'s the sweetest Sweetest It\\'s the sweetest Sweetest It\\'s the sweetest Sweetest It\\'s the sweetest Devotion [Verse 1] When did it go wrong, I will never know I have loved you all my life How did it slow down, I go round and round Thinking about it all the time [Pre-Chorus] I gave you heaven on a platter baby I gave you everything you never gave me I never lied and I never faked it Only wanted for you to save me This love, it ain\\'t over yet There\\'s too much that I haven\\'t said [Chorus] Did you find the note that I wrote? I hid it in the seam of your coat It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat Do you even know that I can\\'t let go [Verse 2] Why were you so cold, let the truth be told Tell me was it all for the thrill? What was I thinking, I gave you everything But you still went for the kill [Pre-Chorus] I gave you heaven on a platter baby I gave you everything you never gave me I never lied and I never faked it Only wanted for you to save me [Chorus] Did you find the note that I wrote? I hid it in the seam of your coat It was hard to write, had a lump in my throat Do you even know that I can\\'t let go [Bridge] Oooh sometimes I feel like I\\'m in the dark Oooh I thought I\\'d die in your arms [Chorus] Did you find the note that I wrote? I hid it in the seam of your coat It was hard to write, I had a lump in my throat Do you even know that I can\\'t let go [Outro] Hope you know, I won\\'t let go I thought I told you, he\\'d be home soon Couldn\\'t help myself, you\\'re too good to be true. I fall short each time, Every time he ain\\'t here You and your charm creep closer Closer and near Like a fool for fire, I fall, with my pride and all. Like a bomb before explosion, Ticking by your call, You\\'re the wiser one, disguised from greed, And I\\'m just a child who belongs on her knees. But I found a boy who I love more, Than I ever did you before, So stand beside the river I cried, And lay yourself down. Look how you want me now that I don\\'t need you. So, you thought that I\\'d crumble to my knees At the first sight of you crawling back to me To whisper \"will you leave your man? \" Cause you swear that this time you can stand by me. I won\\'t stand by you. Cause I found a boy who I love more, Than I ever did you before, So stand beside the river I cried And lay yourself down. Look how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! I ain\\'t yours for no taking, You must be mistaken I could never look into your eyes, and settle for wrong And ignore the right When I found a boy who loves me more, Than you ever did me before. So stand beside the river you cried And lay yourself down! Look how you want me now that I don\\'t need you! Found myself today singing out your name, You said I\\'m crazy, If I am I\\'m crazy for you. Sometimes sitting in the dark wishing you were here Turns me crazy, But it\\'s you who makes me lose my head. And every time I\\'m meant to be acting sensible You drift into my head And turn me into a crumbling fool. Tell me to run and I\\'ll race, If you want me to stop I\\'ll freeze, And if you want me gone. I\\'ll leave, just hold me closer baby, And make me crazy for you. Crazy for you. Lately with this state I\\'m in I can\\'t help myself but spin. I wish you\\'d come over, Send me spinning closer to you. My oh my, how my blood boils, it\\'s sweet taste for you, Strips me down bare And gets me into my favorite mood. I keep on trying, fighting these feelings away, But the more I do, The crazier I turn into. Pacing floors and opening doors, Hoping you\\'ll walk through And save me boy, Because I\\'m too crazy for you. Crazy for you Everybody tells me it\\'s \\'bout time that I moved on And I need to learn to lighten up and learn how to be young But my heart is a valley, it\\'s so shallow and man made I\\'m scared to death if I let you in that you\\'ll see I\\'m just a fake Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch But I know that\\'s just me, \\'cause nothing ever is enough When I was a child I grew up by the River Lea There was something in the water, now that something\\'s in me Oh I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips I can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins It\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins It\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I should probably tell you now before it\\'s way too late That I never meant to hurt you or lie straight to your face Consider this my apology, I know it\\'s years in advance But I\\'d rather say it now in case I never get the chance No, I can\\'t go back, but the reeds are growing out of my fingertips I can\\'t go back to the river But it\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins It\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain It\\'s in my roots, it\\'s in my veins It\\'s in my blood and I stain every heart that I use to heal the pain So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea Yeah I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea So I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea Yeah, I blame it on the River Lea, the River Lea, the River Lea I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham If it hadn\\'t been for love I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana If it hadn\\'t been for love I never woulda run through the blindin\\' rain Without one dollar to my name If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love I never woulda seen the trouble that I\\'m in If it hadn\\'t been for love Woulda been gone like a wayward wind If it hadn\\'t been for love Nobody knows it better than me I wouldn\\'t be wishing I was free If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love Four cold walls against my will At least I know he\\'s lying still Four cold walls without parole Lord have mercy on my soul Four cold walls against my will At least I know he\\'s lying still Four cold walls without parole Lord have mercy on my soul I never woulda hitch-hiked to Birmingham If it hadn\\'t been for love I never woulda caught the train to Louisiana If it hadn\\'t been for love I never woulda loaded up a forty-four Put myself behind a jailhouse door If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love, yes If it hadn\\'t been, if it hadn\\'t been for love, yes Hold my hand while you cut me down It had only just begun but now it\\'s over now And you\\'re in the heat of moments with your heart playing up cold I\\'m between the middle watching hastiness unfold On my eyes you were smiling in the spotlight dancing with the night The night When I fell off your mind I\\'m tired of trying Your teasing ain\\'t enough Fed up of biding your time When I don\\'t get nothing back And for what, and for what, and for what When I don\\'t get nothing back Oy, I\\'m tired Where\\'d you go when you stayed behind I looked up and inside down and outside only to find A double taking punching hard and laughing at my smile I get closer you obviously prefer her I\\'m tired of trying Your teasing ain\\'t enough Fed up of biding your time When I don\\'t get nothing back And for what, and for what, and for what When I don\\'t get nothing back Boy I\\'m tired of trying Your teasing ain\\'t enough Fed up of biding your time When I don\\'t get nothing back And for what, and for what, and for what When I don\\'t get nothing back Oy, I\\'m tired (I should have known) Never mind said your open arms I couldn\\'t help believe they tricked me back into them, even though I\\'m tired of trying Your teasing ain\\'t enough Fed up of biding your time When I don\\'t get nothing back And for what, and for what, and for what When I don\\'t get nothing back Boy I\\'m tired of trying Your teasing ain\\'t enough Fed up of biding your time When I don\\'t get nothing back And for what, and for what, and for what When I don\\'t get nothing back Oy, I\\'m tired Who wants to be right as rain It\\'s better when something is wrong You get excitement in your bones And everything you do\\'s a game When night comes and you\\'re on your own You can say I chose to be alone Who wants to be right as rain It\\'s harder when you\\'re on top \\'Cause when hard work don\\'t pay off And I\\'m tired there ain\\'t no room in my bed As far as I\\'m concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won\\'t be making up I\\'ve cried my heart out And now I\\'ve had enough of love Who wants to be riding high When you\\'ll just crumble back on down You give up everything you are And even then you don\\'t get far They make believe that everything Is exactly what it seems But at least when you\\'re at your worst You know how to feel things \\'Cause when hard work don\\'t pay off And I\\'m tired there ain\\'t no room in my bed As far as I\\'m concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won\\'t be making up I\\'ve cried my heart out And now I\\'ve had enough of love Go ahead and still my heart To make me cry again \\'Cause it will never hurt As much as it did then We were both right And no one had blame But now I give up On this endless game \\'Cause who wants to be right as rain It\\'s better when something is wrong I get excitement in my bones Even though everything\\'s a strain When night comes and I\\'m on my own You should know I chose to be alone Who wants to be right as rain It\\'s harder when you\\'re on top \\'Cause when hard work don\\'t pay off And I\\'m tired there ain\\'t no room in my bed As far as I\\'m concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won\\'t be making up I\\'ve cried my heart out And now I\\'ve had enough of love No room in my bed As far as I\\'m concerned So wipe that dirty smile off We won\\'t be making up I\\'ve cried my heart out And now I\\'ve had enough of love So little to say but so much time Despite my empty mouth the words are in my mind Please wear the face, the one where you smile Because you lighten up my heart when I start to cry Forgive me first love, but I\\'m tired I need to get away to feel again Try to understand why, don\\'t get so close to change my mind Please wipe that look out of your eyes, it\\'s bribing me to doubt myself Simply, it\\'s tiring This love has dried up and stayed behind And if I stay I\\'ll be alive Then choke on words I\\'d always hide Excuse me first love, but we\\'re through I need to taste the kiss from someone new Forgive me first love, but I\\'m too tired I\\'m bored to say the least and I, I lack desire Forgive me first love, forgive me first love, forgive me first love Forgive me first love forgive me, forgive me first love, forgive me first love This is the end Hold your breath and count to ten Feel the earth move and then Hear my heart burst again For this is the end I\\'ve drowned and dreamt this moment So overdue I owe them Swept away, I\\'m stolen Let the skyfall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together Let the skyfall When it crumbles We will stand tall Face it all together At skyfall At skyfall Skyfall is where we start A thousand miles and poles apart Where worlds collide and days are dark You may have my number, you can take my name But you\\'ll never have my heart Let the skyfall (let the sky fall) When it crumbles (when it crumbles) We will stand tall (we will stand tall) Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall) When it crumbles (when it crumbles) We will stand tall (we will stand tall) Face it all together At skyfall [x2:] (Let the sky fall When it crumbles We will stand tall) Where you go I go What you see I see I know I\\'d never be me Without the security Of your loving arms Keeping me from harm Put your hand in my hand And we\\'ll stand Let the skyfall (let the sky fall) When it crumbles (when it crumbles) We will stand tall (we will stand tall) Face it all together Let the skyfall (let the sky fall) When it crumbles (when it crumbles) We will stand tall (we will stand tall) Face it all together At skyfall Let the sky fall We will stand tall At skyfall This is how the story went I met someone by accident It blew me away Blew me away It was in the darkest of my days When you took my sorrow and you took my pain And buried them away, you buried them away I wish I could lay down beside you When the day is done And wake up to your face against the morning sun But like everything I\\'ve ever known You disappear one day So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away Dropped you off at the train station Put a kiss on top of your head Watch you wave And watched you wave Then I went on home to my skyscrapers And neon lights and waiting papers That I call home I call that home I wish I could lay down beside you When the day is done And wake up to your face against the morning sun But like everything I\\'ve ever known You disappear one day So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away, away Woke up feeling heavy-hearted I\\'m going back to where I started The morning rain, the morning rain And though I wish that you were here On that same old road that brought me here It\\'s calling me home, It\\'s calling me home I wish I could lay down beside you When the day is done And wake up to your face against the morning sun But like everything I\\'ve ever known You disappear one day So I spend my whole life hiding my heart away I can\\'t spend my whole life hiding my heart away Right under my feet there\\'s air made of bricks Pulls me down turns me weak for you I find myself repeating like a broken tune And I\\'m forever excusing your intentions That I give in to my pretendings Which forgive you each time Without me knowing They melt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up You say my name like there could be an us I best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love I\\'m the only one in love Each and every time I turn around to leave I feel my heart begin to burst and bleed So desperately I try to link it with my head But instead I fall back to my knees As you tear your way right through me I forgive you once again Without me knowing You\\'ve burnt my heart to stone And I hear your words that I made up You say my name like there could be an us I best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one in love I\\'m the only one in love Why do you steal my hand Whenever I\\'m standing my own ground You build me up, then leave me dead I hear your words you made up I say your name like there should be an us I best tidy up my head I\\'m the only one, in love I\\'m the only one in love Fool that I am for falling in love with you And fool that I am for thinking you loved me too You took my heart then played the part of little coquette And my dreams just disappeared like the smoke from a cigarette Fool that I am for hoping you\\'d understand And thinking you would listen to all of the things The things I had planned But we couldn\\'t see eye to eye So darling Darling Darling this is goodbye Oh I still care Fool that I am Ooh I still care Fool that I am You say it\\'s all in my head And the things I think just don\\'t make sense So where you been then? Don\\'t go all coy Don\\'t turn it round on me like it\\'s my fault See I can see that look in your eyes The one that shoots me each and every time You grace me with your cold shoulder Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You shower me with words made of knives Whenever you look at me I wish I was her These days when I see you You make it look like I\\'m see-through Do tell me why you waste our time When your heart ain\\'t in it, and you\\'re not satisfied You know I know just how you feel I\\'m starting to find myself feeling that way too When you grace me with your cold shoulder Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You shower me with words made of knives Whenever you look at me I wish I was her Time and time again, I play the role of fool (Just for you) Even in the daylight when you think that (I don\\'t see you) Try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find Though I do know how you play You grace me with your cold shoulder Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You shower me with words made of knives Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You grace me with your cold shoulder Whenever you look at me I wish I was her You shower me with words made of knives Whenever you look at me I wish I was her [Adele] Why do you love me Do you love me...?

For a little confidence I\\'ll grab But when my hand goes out don\\'t take it for I\\'m trying to make it on my own I fell it in my bones any minute now! This train of thought will leave the statio My impatience will come out to play You\\'ve turned out to be the only face I see! Running through the empty hallways I can tell that I am not alone You spin a web in every room You spin a web in every room And try to break the backbone that I\\'ve grown Will I make my own path or wander where I\\'m thrown Will I make my own path or wander where I\\'m thrown Or wander where I\\'m thrown? When we used To say goodnight I\\'d always kiss And hold you tight But lately You don\\'t seem To care You close the door And leave me Standing there Oh, honey That\\'s not fair That\\'s it I quit I\\'m movin\\' on The other night We had a date An you showed up Two hours late And though your hair Was all in place Somebody smeared Their lipstick On your face Oh, they smeared it Every place Ye that\\'s it honey I quit I\\'m movin\\' on [Chorus] You made me want you You made me leave you You made me tumble And fall But if I Can\\'t have you the way I want you I don\\'t want you at all Baby, I can take a lot \\'Cause I love Everything you got Though your kisses Fill me So if you got Someone else I gotta go Oh, that you know Ye that\\'s it honey I quit I\\'m movin\\' on [Chorus] Baby I can take a lot \\'Cause I love Everything you got Though your kisses Fill me So if you got Someone else I gotta go Oh, that you know So that\\'s it baby I quit I\\'m movin\\' on Ye that\\'s it baby I quit now I\\'m movin\\' on Don\\'t ask me What you know is true Don\\'t have to tell you I love your precious heart I was standing You were there Two worlds collided And they could never tear us apart We could live For a thousand years But if I hurt you I\\'d make wine from your tears I told you That we could fly \\'Cause we all have wings But some of us don\\'t know why I I was standing You were there Two worlds collided And they could never ever tear us apart I know sometimes you\\'re scared of the light But how will you ever know if you never try There\\'s something new inside my heart And it grabs like a child whenever we\\'re apart I see your face under every sky I find the less I look, more I find So let\\'s go back there, back to the star You know I\\'m never gonna leave you You\\'re the only one I want Let\\'s go back there, back to the star You know I\\'m never gonna leave you You\\'re the only one I want You know sometimes that I\\'m scared of the dark But I\\'m feeling sun babe when I\\'m in your arms You said my name in the dead of glory You hold me alright When I\\'m short of falling So let\\'s go back there, back to the star You know I\\'m never gonna leave you You\\'re the only one I want Let\\'s go back there, back to the star You know I\\'m never gonna leave you You\\'re the only one I want There will be times When we\\'ll try to give it up Bursting out, it seems no doubt that will almost fall apart than burn to pieces And we\\'ll watch them turn to dust But without each other, nothing is easy enough So let\\'s go back there, back to the star You know I\\'m never gonna leave you You\\'re the only one I want Let\\'s go back there, back to the star You know I\\'m never gonna leave you \\'cause you\\'re the only one I want, yeah You\\'re the only one Never gonna leave you No, I\\'m never gonna leave you, no Go ahead, go ahead and smash it on the floor Take whatever is left, and take it with you out the door See if I cry See if I shed a single sorry tear Can\\'t say that it\\'s been that great No in fact it\\'s been a wasted worried year [Chorus] Everybody sees And everyone agrees That you and I are wrong And it\\'s been that way to long Take it as it comes And be thankful when it\\'s done There\\'s so many ways to act And there\\'s many shades of black There\\'s so many shades of black Let it out, let it all out Say what\\'s on your mind You can kick and scream and shout and say things that are so unkind Yeah-see if I care, see if I stand firm or if I fall Cause in the back of my mind, and on the tip of my tongue Is the answer to it all [Chorus] Yeah there\\'s many shades of black [Chorus] Cause there\\'s many shades of black There\\'s so many shades of black Yeah there\\'s any shades of black There\\'s so many shades of black Yeah there\\'s many shades of black There\\'s so many shades of black And there\\'s many shades of black There\\'s so many shades of black Go ahead...

around Insider information, hand in your resignation Loss of a good friend best of intentions I found Tight lipped procrastination Yeah later, see you around (Here we go motherfuckers) Do you want to come to a party My friends picked me up in their truck at 11:30 This things at a frat house but the people are cool there Reluctant I followed but I never dreamed there Would be someone there who would catch my attention I wasn\\'t out searching for love or affection So I paid my 3 and the girls got in free Shine the beer for tequila and we headed into the party And then in the backyard some terrible ska band Someone in the background was doing a keg stand This place is so lame all these girls look the same All these guys have no game I wish I would have stayed In my bed back at home watching TV alone Where I\\'d put on some porn or have sex on the phone Far from people I hate down from anywhere state Trying to intoxicate girls to give them head after the party And then I saw her standing there With green eyes and long blond hair She wasn\\'t wearing underwear at least I prayed that She might be the one maybe we\\'d have some fun Maybe we\\'d watch the sun rise But that night I learned some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard to impress With the way that they dress With those things on their chests And the things they suggest to me I couldn\\'t believe what this lady was saying The names she was dropping the games she was playing She dated this guy who now rides for Black Fly\\'s How she\\'s down with the Iwise well constructed disguise Now I\\'d rather go dateless than stay here and hate this Her volume of makeup her fake tits were tasteless So I said I\\'d call her but never would bother Until I got turned down by another girl at a party So when you see her standing there With green eyes and long blonde hair She won\\'t be wearing underwear and you\\'ll discover This girl\\'s not the one and she\\'ll never be fun You should just turn and run because you\\'ll find out that Some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard to impress With the way that they dress With those things on their chest And the things they suggest to me Some girls try too hard Some girls try too hard I wanna have the same last dream again The one where I wake up and I\\'m alive Just as the four walls close me within My eyes are open up with pure sunlight I\\'m the first to know My dearest friends Even if your hope has burned with time Anything that is dead shall be re-grown And your vicious pain, your warning sign You will be fine hey yo here I am And here we go Life\\'s waiting to begin Any type of love it will be shown Like every single tree reach for the sky If you\\'re gonna to fall I\\'ll let you know That I will pick you up Like you for I I felt this thing I can\\'t replace Where everyone was working for this goal Where all the children left without a trace Only to come back as pure as gold To

I\\'ve been sitting here, looking at your picture and getting more homesick every minute. I\\'ve wanted that picture more than anything else I know of, except, of course, you yourself. I keep thinking of you, Darling, keep wishing I could be home with you. I want to leave in the worst possible way so I can come home to see you, but things don\\'t look so good on that subject. But this war has spoiled a lot of things for everyone, I guess. I\\'ve never been so lonesome in my life as I am right now. I\\'m completely lost without you, Darling. I never realized I could miss any one person so much. I just hope it won\\'t be too much longer until I\\'m able to be with you again... and live a sane and normal life. I\\'m sick of always hearing All the sad songs on the radio All day it is there to remind an over sensitive guy That he\\'s lost and alone, yeah I hate our favorite restaurant, favorite movie, our favorite show We would stay up all through the night We would laugh and get high And never answer the phone I can\\'t forgive Can\\'t forget Can\\'t give in what went wrong \\'Cause you said this was right You fucked up my life I\\'m sick of always hearing Sappy love songs on the radio This place is fucking cursed in its plague And I can never escape when my heart it explodes I can\\'t forgive Can\\'t forget Can\\'t give in what went wrong Cause you said this was right You fucked up my life I\\'m kicking out fiercely of the world around me What went wrong I\\'m kicking Don\\'t wanna hear the static on the TV screen Don\\'t wanna live a life of cellphone memories When did you go missing? Where did I go wrong? Sometimes I just don\\'t know where I belong Save yourself where I was saving We\\'re not the same, we\\'re two in a million These are the good old days These are the good old days We\\'ve gone through hell, the battles we fought \\'em We stood as one, the young and forgotten These are the good old days These are the good old days You\\'re not the only one who grew up feeling scared You\\'re not the only broken heart gone un-repaired Everyone\\'s gone missing Everyone\\'s done wrong Sometimes we both fly too close to the sun Save yourself where I was saving We\\'re not the same, we\\'re two in a million These are the good old days These are the good old days We\\'ve gone through hell, the battles we fought \\'em We stood as one, the young and forgotten These are the good old days These are the good old days You\\'re giving up We\\'re getting out We were young and we\\'re not growing up We\\'re not growing up You\\'re giving up We\\'re getting out We were young and we\\'re not growing up We\\'re not growing up Save yourself where I was saving We\\'re not the same, we\\'re two in a million These are the good old days These are the good old days We\\'ve gone through hell, the battles we fought \\'em We stood as one, the young and forgotten These are the good old days These are the good old days These are the good old days These are the good old days These are the good old days These are the good old days Last night it came as a picture With a good reason, a warning sign This place is void of all passion If you can imagine it\\'s easy if you try Believe me I failed this effort I wrote a reminder this wasn\\'t a vision This time where are you Houston Is somebody out there will somebody listen Should I go back should I go back should I I feel alone and tired Should I go back should I go back should I I hope I won\\'t forget you My head is made up of memories Most of them useless delusions This room is bored of rehearsal And sick of the boundaries I miss you so much Should I go back should I go back should I I feel alone and tired Should I go back should I go back should I This time I don\\'t want to Should I go back should I go back should I I feel alone and tired Should I go back should I go back should I I hope I won\\'t forget you Should I go back should I go back should I I feel alone and tired Should I go back should I go back should I This time I don\\'t want to Should I go back should I go back should I I feel alone and tired Should I go back should I go back should I I hope I won\\'t forget you Sometimes I wonder where our lives go They question who we used to be Sometimes I feel like I\\'m the oxygen between The cigarette and gasoline I can\\'t sleep \\'cause what if I dream Of going back to San Diego We bought a one way ticket So we could go see the Cure And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego) Can\\'t go back to San Diego (can\\'t go back to San Diego) Abandoned houses with the lights on (oh, oh, oh) Late at night I call your name (oh, oh, oh, oh) Abandoned love songs smashed across the hardwood floors I read the sadness on your face I can\\'t sleep \\'cause what if I dream Of going back to San Diego We bought a one way ticket So we could go see the Cure And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot And think of every person I ever lost in San Diego (to San Diego) Can\\'t go back to San Diego (can\\'t go back to San Diego) I never needed to hear All of the pain and the fear Your secrets filled up my ears Like the ocean blue I never wanted to know How deep these cuts on you go And like a river they flow To the ocean blue Going back to San Diego We bought a one way ticket So we could go see the Cure And listen to our favorite songs in the parking lot And think of every person I ever lost at San Diego (San Diego) (to San Diego) Can\\'t go back to San Diego (San Diego) (can\\'t go back to San Diego) I got no regret right now (I\\'m feeling this) The air is so cold and numb (I\\'m feeling this) Let me go in her room (I\\'m feeling this) I wanna take off her clothes (I\\'m feeling this) Show me the way to bed (I\\'m feeling this) Show me the way you move (I\\'m feeling this) Fuck it it\\'s such a blur (I\\'m feeling this) I love all the things you do (I\\'m feeling this) Fate fell short this time Your smile fades in the summer Place your hand in mine I\\'ll leave when I wanna Where do we go from here Turn all the lights down now Smiling from ear to ear (I\\'m feeling this) Our breathing has got too loud (I\\'m feeling this) Show me the bedroom floor (I\\'m feeling this) Show me the bathroom mirror (I\\'m feeling this) Were taking this way too slow (I\\'m feeling this) Take me away from here (I\\'m feeling this) Fate fell short this time Your smile fades in the summer Place your hand in mine I\\'ll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time Your smile fades in the summer Place your hand in mine I\\'ll leave when I wanna This place was never the same again after you came and went How can you say you meant anything different To anyone standing alone on the street With a cigarette on the first night we met Look to the past and remember her smile And maybe tonight I can breathe for a while I\\'m not in this scene I think I\\'m falling asleep But then all that it means is I\\'ll always be dreaming of you Fate fell short this time Your smile fades in the summer Place your hand in mine I\\'ll leave when I wanna Fate fell short this time (Fate fell short this time) Your smile fades in the summer (Your smile fades in the summer) Place your hand in mine (Place your hand in mine) I\\'ll leave when I wanna (I\\'ll leave when I wanna) Fate fell short this time (Fate fell short this time) Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned) Place your hand in mine (Place your hand in mine) I\\'ll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time (Are we alone do you feel it) Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned) Place your hand in mine (Are we alone do you feel it) I\\'ll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned) Fate fell short this time (Are we alone do you feel it) Your smile fades in the summer (So lost and disillusioned) Place your hand in mine (Are we alone do you feel it) I\\'ll leave when I wanna (So lost and disillusioned) I know I messed up and it might be over But let me call you when I\\'m sober I\\'m a dandelion, you\\'re a four-leaf clover But let me call you when I\\'m sober Naa, na na na

I guess its just another I guess its just another I guess its just another night alone Now as I walk down the street I need a job just to sleep in sheets Buying food every once in a while But not enough to purchase a smile A tank of gas is a treasure to me I know now that nothing is free I talk to you every now and then I never felt so alone again Just you wait and see As school life is a It is a woken dream Aren\\'t you feeling alone? I guess its just another I guess its just another I guess its just another night alone Let\\'s get started, the faint and broken-hearted Hold it up, I\\'ve got something I cannot hide Worst painkiller, that all-in filler The apart and departed look in my eyes Sad, how far you ran, I\\'ll search this land Up through the clouds then back here We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb At all hours I\\'m empty like the day after Christmas Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye You left me on the day after Christmas There\\'s nothing left to say, and so goodnight I will follow the trail to tomorrow With my loneliness with sorrow all through the night Sons and daughters, mothers and their fathers Just the bridges and the waters their clues left behind Sad, how far you ran, I\\'ll search this land Up through the clouds then back here We could reignite like fireflies, like an atom bomb At all hours I\\'m empty like the day after Christmas Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye You left me on the day after Christmas There\\'s nothing left to say, and so goodnight I\\'m empty like the day after Christmas Swept beneath the wave of your goodbye You left me on the day after Christmas There\\'s nothing left to say, and so goodnight There\\'s nothing left to say, and so goodnight Goodnight There she was like a starry night Like a Ferris wheel, full of blue green eyes And a heart of steel always on her own Almost never real When the night will begin The pain it won\\'t end even if she falls in love Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack Even if she falls in love And she was like a blade of ice Like a lonely road clears day of life Always sharp and cold always beautiful I am such a fool When the night will begin The pain won\\'t end even if she falls in love Fact you wanna turn back your heart will attack Even if she falls in love Try to look in her eyes the light is just right Even if she falls in love and it isn\\'t so bad it\\'s Driving you mad even if she falls in love There\\'s a cynical feeling saying I should give up You said everything you\\'ll ever say There\\'s a moment of panic when I hear the phone ring Anxiety\\'s calling in my head Is it back again? Are you back again? Don\\'t wake me up before you leave Is there the slightest trace of what you once believed (woah oh oh oh) I feel your hand unlock the door Leaving fingerprints of water in the oil (woah oh oh oh) What\\'s the point of saying sorry now Lost my voice while fighting my way out (while fighting my way out) What\\'s the point of saying sorry now (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I\\'m not sorry) Lost my voice while fighting my way out (not sorry, not sorry, not sorry, I\\'m not sorry now) Dear head, shut up I can\\'t listen no more It\\'s late, so shut up Is one night too much to ask for You are a haunted house You\\'re superstitious You are the coldest stone-carved marble faces I won\\'t fall down that fucking rabbit hole I\\'m barely standing on the ground All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all I won\\'t fall down that fucking rabbit hole With you, with you, with you, with you again With you, with you, with you, with you again This bed, on fire I can\\'t sleep here no more Too late and tired Dreaming down on the floor I\\'m a haunted house I\\'m superstitious I am a cardboard cutout, old and faded I won\\'t fall down that fucking rabbit hole I\\'m barely standing on the ground All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all I won\\'t fall down that fucking rabbit hole With you, with you, with you, with you again With you, with you, with you, with you again With you, with you, with you, with you again With you, with you, with you, with you again I won\\'t fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won\\'t fall down, I won\\'t fall down) I\\'m barely standing on the ground (Barely standing on the ground) All the hints that you leave are too hard to believe at all I won\\'t fall down that fucking rabbit hole (I won\\'t fall down that fucking rabbit hole) Oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh Oh, oh, oh, oh Where the hell did you come from, outer space or heaven above Short of breath my long-lost love I can\\'t believe my eyes, are you for real? My life before was such a mess There\\'s no use dwelling on the past My broken heart was in a cast Then you showed up and it began to heal \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing that matters \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing that\\'s real \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing I\\'ll never let go \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing I feel Someday You\\'ll come back to me And I\\'ll say Something bitterly And you\\'ll go racing toward the kitchen Grab a knife, erase my vision Take my flatscreen television And my paintings by Marilyn Manson \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing that matters \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing that\\'s real \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing I\\'ll never let go \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing I feel \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing that matters \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing that\\'s real \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing I\\'ll never let go \\'Cause you\\'re the only thing I feel Six bottles went down the drain One hours waste of time I\\'d ask if you feel the same Still pushing that chance to try Your breath in this cool room chill Long hair that blows side to side You speak and make time stand still And each time walk right on by? Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever, and after Can\\'t count all the eyes that stare Can\\'t count all the things they see She kills with no life to spare Just victims left to bleed One drink and the pain goes down Soft shadows lay by her feet Lay soft as you slowly drown Lay still while you fall asleep (Fall asleep) Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after (And after, and after, and after) Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after Like violence you have me, forever, and after Like violence you kill me, forever and after Push it out, fake a smile Avert disaster just in time I need a drink, cause in a while Worthless answers from friends of mine It\\'s dumb to ask, cool to ignore Girls possess me but they\\'re never mine I made my entrance Avoided hazards Checked my engine I fell behind I fell behind She makes me feel like it\\'s raining outside And when the storms gone I\\'m all torn up inside I\\'m always nervous on days like this like the prom I get too scared to move cause I\\'m a fuckin\\' boy Remember when I was in The grocery store, now\\'s my time Lost the words, lost the nerve, Lost the girl, left the line I would wish upon a star But that star, it doesn\\'t shine So read my book, with a boring ending A short story of a lonely guy Who fell behind She makes me feel like it\\'s raining outside And when the storms gone I\\'m all torn up inside I\\'m always nervous on days like this like the prom I get too scared to move cause I\\'m a fuckin\\' boy She makes me feel like it\\'s raining outside And when the storms gone I\\'m all torn up inside I\\'m always nervous on days like this like the prom I get too scared to move cause I\\'m still Just a stupid, worthless boy She didn\\'t mean to deceive you, believe me But sometimes the hardest part is conceiving The good intentions that you had Now only came to this And although she saw the mark The arrow missed It isn\\'t exciting reciting the stories Of kind words turned hurting when routine gets boring Both getting tired of punk rock clubs And both playing in punk rock bands The start was something good But some good things must end And she said, \"It could never survive With such differing lives One home, one out on tour again We may never come back The strike of a match The candle\\'s burning at both ends.\" And now she knows too much And I\\'m too fucked up It\\'s awkward trying to make my move I\\'ll pretend that I\\'m fine Show up right on time But I know I\\'ll never be that cool I never wanted to hold you back I just wanted to hold on But my chance is gone I know just where I stand, a boy Trapped in the body of a man and I\\'ll take what you\\'re willing to give And I\\'ll teach myself to live With a walk-on part of a background shot From a movie I\\'m not in She\\'s so important And I\\'m so retarded And now I realize I should have kissed you in L.A. But I drove home all alone As if I had a choice, anyway Where are you coming from? What are you running from? Is it so hard to see? And if you\\'re feeling scared Remember the time we shared You know it meant everything (everything) You know that it meant everything to me You know that it meant everything to me I think of awhile ago We might have had it all But I was so stupid then You needed time to grow But now just as things change As well my feelings do In time things rearrange I am so sick of chasing you But what do I get \\'Cause I just seem to lose You make me regret Those times I spent with you And playing those games A I wait for your call And now I give up, So goodbye and so long It\\'s not a change of pace This time I\\'ll get it right It\\'s not a change of taste I was the one there last night You have your other friends They were there When you cried Didn\\'t mean to hurt you then Best friends just won\\'t Leave your side But what do I get \\'Cause I just seem to lose You make me regret Those times I spent with you And playing those games As I wait for your call And now I give up, So goodbye and so long It\\'s not a change of pace This time I\\'ll get it right It\\'s not a change of taste I was the one there last night When I needed you most When I needed a friend You let me down now Like I let you down then So sorry, it\\'s over (Ah) One thing / I don\\'t know why It doesn\\'t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme To explain in due time All I know time is a valuable thing Watch it fly by as the pendulum swings Watch it count down to the end of the day The clock ticks life away It\\'s so unreal Didn\\'t look out below Watch the time go right out the window Trying to hold on / but didn\\'t even know Wasted it all just to Watch you go I kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn\\'t even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn\\'t even matter One thing / I don\\'t know why It doesn\\'t even matter how hard you try Keep that in mind / I designed this rhyme To remind myself how I tried so hard In spite of the way you were mocking me Acting like I was part of your property Remembering all the times you fought with me I\\'m surprised it got so (far) Things aren\\'t the way they were before You wouldn\\'t even recognize me anymore Not that you knew me back then But it all comes back to me In the end You kept everything inside and even though I tried / it all fell apart What it meant to me / will eventually / be a memory / of a time when I I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn\\'t even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn\\'t even matter I\\'ve put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There\\'s only one thing you should know I\\'ve put my trust in you Pushed as far as I can go For all this There\\'s only one thing you should know I tried so hard And got so far But in the end It doesn\\'t even matter I had to fall To lose it all But in the end It doesn\\'t even matter I saw you again I think you used me again Should we try this before we give up and move on And pretend to restore what we have and hold on At times like these It\\'s obvious I saw you again I know you fucked him again Can you comfort yourself with a sense of revenge Are you leaving me here with the taste of the end At times like these It\\'s obvious At times like these It\\'s obvious I saw you again and again and again There\\'s some room to move on, to move on, to move on And I saw you again and again and again How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again There\\'s some room to move on, to move on, to move on And I saw you again and again and again How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again There\\'s some room to move on, to move on, to move on And I saw you again and again and again How do we fix this if we never have vision I saw you again and again and again There\\'s some room to move on, to move on, to move on And I saw you again and again and again How do we fix this if we never have vision Day in day out Up at 3 AM with the searchlights shining down Day in day out It\\'s the blinding light underneath the dirt downtown Whoa Listen to the sound as they bomb the Sixth Street Bridge Whoa Listen to the sound of the voices south of Fifth In Los Angeles, when will you save me Los Angeles when will you save me Los Angeles, when will you save me Los Angeles, I\\'m never coming home (I\\'m never coming, I\\'m never coming) Come down I\\'ve been awake for days Knocked out By the sound of falling rain Come down yeah we\\'ll watch the sun just burn away the sky Watch the city lights die out up on Mulholland Drive Los Angeles, when will you save me Los Angeles, when will you save me Los Angeles, when will you save me Los Angeles, I\\'m never coming home Wake me when this war is over Meet me where the skyline ends Wake me when this war is over Meet me where the skyline ends Wake me when this war is over Meet me where the skyline ends Los Angeles when will you save me Los Angeles when will you save me Los Angeles when will you save me Los Angeles I\\'m never coming home I\\'m never coming home I\\'m never coming home I\\'m never coming home I\\'m never coming home [Verse 1: Matt Skiba] Late at night on mercy street The summer air is way too sweet The way I feel inside is worse than poison Washed up standing on a beach Something inside is incomplete I numb the pain for one more night of mourning This is the one last time I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)] (I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for (The last train home) [Verse 2: Mark Hoppus] The tidal wave and aftermath I\\'m seasick from the years we\\'ve passed Adrift at sea with no one left to rescue Tonic and a fifth of gin She said goodbye and left again These empty rooms are deafening without you This is one last time I promise one last time [Chorus: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)] (I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for (The last train home) [Bridge: Mark Hoppus and Matt Skiba] Life\\'s so strange Time won\\'t change The world slips by, I\\'m afraid that she never gave much anyway Life\\'s so strange [Outro: Mark Hoppus (Matt Skiba)] (I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for (The last train home) (I\\'ll take the last train home) The only time I feel alive is when I find something I would die for (The last train home) '"
